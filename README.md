# D2D-disaster-management


Cotains the code for the project CS F366.

## Introduction 
Wireless industry, driven by manifold increase in data and devices, is
attracting the attention of public safety services for critical communications under
disaster scenarios and unpredictable events. In this project we come up with a novel
D2D based solution to combat network connectivity during times of natural
disasters. The solution should address problems due to low coverage, limited battery
life of devices, unavailability of online service etc. , at the same time maintain a
minimum data rate.
In this project we will simulate a disaster scenario and using device to device
communication. we will identify the devices with low battery and using a disaster
management server, we will store their information and finally locate them and
transfer their SOS signals via device to device communication to any active base
station.
